# Intelligent Disaster Emergency Evacuation System

## Introduction

Modern buildings around the world have become complex and augmented. Given the structural characteristics of modern buildings, quick evacuation using emergency exits or evacuee guidance markers during blackouts due to fire, building collapse, earthquakes, or aging of buildings, gas leakage, AC leakage needs to be possible.

This project suggests an Internet of Things (IoT) - based solution called Intelligent Disaster Emergency Evacuation System, which can control directional guidance intelligently according to the time and location of a disaster and the design of an integrated control system using wireless sensor networks to address the problems in times of fire or building collapse.

Taking more than 20 minutes to evacuate from a fire, one of the most frequent disasters, earthquakes, building collapse, gas leakage, and aging of buildings, reduces survivability. 
 
Uniform evacuation guidance such as exit lights is inadequate for guiding evacuees during a fire, which can create poisonous gases or when buildings are collapsing. This project suggests an IoT-based intelligent emergency evacuation system with decentralized control that can intelligently guide evacuees based on the location and time of a fire to minimize the loss of human life in huge buildings.

## Existing System

In the existing system, official agencies widely used the disaster warning sound system to send public emergency information during disaster time. In addition, the emergency lighting system is available during a disaster.
 

## Project

### Emergency doors and windows opening system:

During the disaster, opening locked doors and windows may consume time. So the integrated control system monitors the PIR sensors' status, and all the doors and windows open when needed to provide an easy escape.
