# Intelligent Disaster Emergency Evacuation System

## Introduction

Modern buildings around the world have become complex and augmented. Given the structural characteristics of modern buildings, quick evacuation using emergency exits or evacuee guidance markers during blackouts due to fire, building collapse, earthquakes, or aging of buildings, gas leakage, AC leakage needs to be possible.

This project suggests an Internet of Things (IoT) - based solution called Intelligent Disaster Emergency Evacuation System, which can control directional guidance intelligently according to the time and location of a disaster and the design of an integrated control system using wireless sensor networks to address the problems in times of fire or building collapse.

Taking more than 20 minutes to evacuate from a fire, one of the most frequent disasters, earthquakes, building collapse, gas leakage, and aging of buildings, reduces survivability. 
 
Uniform evacuation guidance such as exit lights is inadequate for guiding evacuees during a fire, which can create poisonous gases or when buildings are collapsing. This project suggests an IoT-based intelligent emergency evacuation system with decentralized control that can intelligently guide evacuees based on the location and time of a fire to minimize the loss of human life in huge buildings.

## Existing System

In the existing system, official agencies widely used the disaster warning sound system to send public emergency information during disaster time. In addition, the emergency lighting system is available during a disaster.
 

## Project

### Emergency doors and windows opening system:

During the disaster, opening locked doors and windows may consume time. So the integrated control system monitors the PIR sensors' status, and all the doors and windows open when needed to provide an easy escape.

Guide lights toward the optimal evacuation locations lit during disasters through cooperation between the disaster prevention system of the relevant building and the government central disaster prevention system.

Autonomous cars can detect surroundings using various techniques such as radar, GPS,   and computer vision. This car automatically arrives at the entrance using the sensor's data for navigation.
 
A smartphone app was developed to alert evacuees of the building to fire and allow evacuees who could not escape by following the emergency lights and whose visibility was obstructed by smoke to check their location and the evacuation path.

The app provides the building blueprints and evacuation map necessary for evacuation to 2G phones as text information and 3G phones as text information and in the form of an App. The voice guiding system helps to evacuate by telling the correct exit direction on each floor to prevent being lost.
 
### H/W and S/W Specification

### Detection Sensors

Sensors such as smoke detectors, flame detectors, heat detectors, vibration sensors, ultrasonic sensors, pressure sensors, proximity sensors, ac leakage detectors, gas detectors, and location control sensors convert and output the recognition of fire, information on the progression of fire and poisonous gas, a vibrational state of the building, gas leakage, ac leakage into an electric signal.

### Flame Sensors

A flame detector sensor is a sensor designed to detect and respond to the presence of a flame or fire, allowing flame detection. When used in industrial furnace applications, their role is to confirm that the furnace is properly; in these cases, they take no direct action beyond notifying the operator or control system. A flame detector can often respond faster and more accurately than a smoke or heat detector. Due to its mechanisms, it uses to detect the flame.
