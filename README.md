# Intelligent Disaster Emergency Evacuation System

## Introduction

Modern buildings around the world have become complex and augmented. Given the structural characteristics of modern buildings, quick evacuation using emergency exits or evacuee guidance markers during blackouts due to fire, building collapse, earthquakes, or aging of buildings, gas leakage, AC leakage needs to be possible.

 This project suggests an Internet of Things (IoT) - based solution called Intelligent Disaster Emergency Evacuation System, which can control directional guidance intelligently according to the time and location of a disaster and the design of an integrated control system using wireless sensor networks to address the problems in times of fire or building collapse.
